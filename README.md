## User Experience (UX)

Tablefor2 is an online booking system that allows users of the site to register online to make/edit or cancel bookings.

The client would like users of the site to register with the site to allow for user identifcation, select times that are listed on the site so to avoid selecting out of hour periods, provide an unique email to all bookings so that the client can make contact with the user if need be (future updates to the system), plus to provide each booking as unique to avoid double booking.

#### Key information for the site:
- What is on the Menu.
- What Times are availble for booking.
- Register/Sign in page.
- How to make a booking.
- View bookings already made.
- Which bookings are pending approval (which can be edited or deleted) and approved (which can only be deleted by the user).

### User Stories

#### Client Goals:
- To be able to view the site on a range of device sizes.
- To make it easy for potential customers (the user) to find out what is on offer (menu) and how to make a booking.
- To make it clear to the user what times are available for bookings.
- To allow users to view the bookings made and prevent double bookings.
- Approve bookings.

#### User/Customer Goals:
- I want to know what Tablefor2 offers in terms of a menu etc.
- I want to register an account so that I can make a booking/reservation.
- I want to make a booking by selecting a time and date for my reservation.
- I want to be able to view a list of my bookings so that I know what has been booked etc.
- I want to be able to edit a booking so that I can make changes if needed and prior to approval.
- I want to be able to cancel/delete a booking (whether it is pending approval or approved).

## Design

### Typography

The Font used is lato & Merriweather which is easy to read and easy on the eye.

## Features

The website is comprised of a home page, login, register and sign out pages, a booking page, an update bookings page and a Your Bookings page.

All Pages on the website are responsive and have:

- The title of the site at the top of every page. This title also acts as a link back to the home page.

- The Buttons will highlight when the cursor is hovering over them, This is to indicate to the user that this button is the one that is being selected:

### General features on each page

### The Home Page

The home page of TableFor2 displays the sites name as a title and then a container which holds some welcome text, the times and menu. The Welcome Text will change for the user, from indicating that the user will need to sign in to make a booking to providing links to make a booking when signed in:

- When the user is not registered or signed in:
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109948740/234085541-666f3c25-b19f-49c7-ab91-0d5935b15c17.png)


- When the user is signed in:
  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109948740/234085691-572b8c89-130c-45ae-bb7b-2a0b537843c3.png)


Another feature to notify that the user is signed in or not is the Nav-bar will change from providing links to the Register/Login pages to Make a Booking, Your Bookings and Logout pages:

- When the user is not registered or signed in:

  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109948740/234086164-c78ad6b0-7a59-46ca-b78d-15ef42c049d4.png)


- When the user is signed in:

  ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109948740/234086102-31519ca7-2e85-4294-81de-64774032ab85.png)


The Times portion of the home page (this is displayed to the user, whether they are logged in or not) and all times are based on GMT, which means that users will need to take into account the time difference if located in a different timezone:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109948740/234086515-004fe18f-fe1a-48d4-91af-799e131a23fa.png)

The Menu is also displayed to the user regardless of login/Registeration and is a collapsible list when clicked on consisting of Starter, Main Course and Dessert selections:

### Make a Booking Page:

This consists of short sentences outlining what the user can and cannot do such as how many guests the user can have, a link to the home page for the user to be reminded of the available times and an additional note that each booking must have an email which will give a booking its uniqueness and so if the user wishes to book on behalf of a friend on the same day as a booking they made, a different email will allow the user to proceed with the booking.

The user will be notifed by error message if the following happens:
- Double booking - as mentioned above, if the user inputs the same email and selects the same day as a booking that is already made, it will be rejected.
- Day in the past - if the user selects a day in the past, an error message will appear preventing the user from booking.
- Time in the past - if the user selects a time in the past, an error message will appear preventing the user from booking.
- Number of guests - if the user selects more than 6 and less than 1, an error message will appear preventing the user from booking.

### Your Bookings page:

This outlines the bookings the user has made, whether it is pending approval or is approved. It is also the page in which the user can edit bookings but only if they are pending approval. Any Booking that is approved can only be deleted. When there is no bookings, rather than have a blank page, there will be a message displayed to the user that there is no bookings and a link be available to direct the user to the Make a booking page.

- Page with no bookings:

### Update Bookings page:

If the user wishes to update their booking, by clicking on the green EDIT BOOKING button, the user will be redirected to a new update bookings page which will have all the details of teh booking you wish to edit. When the user has made the required updates (provided that the user has followed the same criteria as the Make a bookings page e.g. guests between 1-6, cannot book a day in the past etc.) by clicking on the update booking button, the user will return to the Your Bookings page with the message (Booking has been updated successfully) and the booking will appear with the new updates.

- Update Bookings page (with updates):

- Yours Bookings page with the message and updated booking:

 - - -
 
### Delete Booking function:

The final part to the bookings page is the delete function which is indicated to the user as a bright red button. Once the button is clicked a modal will appear with a warning to the user that the action will result in the booking being deleted, in which the user can either delete the booking or click close to return to the Your Bookings page.

### Future Implementations

- Special request textbox for customers/users. Allow users to leave a special reguest with their bookings.
- Automated email sent to user - use Javascript to issue a automated email (via emailJS) outlining the details of their booking and that it is pending approval, plus an email to be issued to user when booking is approved.
- A notifcation to be sent to the site admin that there are bookings pending approval.
- Add a js listener for the checkbox in the Sign in page so that users can be automatically signed in when they logon to the website.

### Accessibility

- Using semantic HTML.
- Using descriptive alt attributes on images on the site.
- Providing information for screen readers where there are icons used and no text - such as the icons beside each menu section & footer icons.
- Ensuring that there is a sufficient colour contrast throughout the site.
